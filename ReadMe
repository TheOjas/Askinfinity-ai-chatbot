⚙️ How It Works
User types a message in one of the chatbot modes.

The message is displayed in the chat UI.

JavaScript sends the input to Gemini API via fetch.

Gemini responds with a reply which is displayed with animation.

The entire chat is stored locally for persistent UX.

Users can toggle dark/light mode and switch modes seamlessly.
